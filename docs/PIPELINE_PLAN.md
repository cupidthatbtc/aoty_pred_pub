# Pipeline Plan (Publication-Focused)

This plan defines the full rebuild for Bayesian artist-level prediction.

Phase 0 - Governance and Guardrails
- Define the prediction target: next album user score for an artist.
- Lock leakage rules (see docs/LEAKAGE_CONTROLS.md).
- Define split policy:
  - Primary: within-artist temporal holdout (last album per artist).
  - Secondary: artist-group split (no artist overlap).
- Define the minimal publication metrics and diagnostics.

Phase 1 - Data Ingestion
- Input: all_albums_full.csv.
- Validate schema (expected columns and types).
- Rename raw headers to canonical names (see RAW_TO_CANONICAL).
- Normalize string fields (artist, album, genre, descriptors).
- Deduplicate records deterministically.
- Record data hash and row counts in lineage logs.

Phase 2 - Filtering and Cleaning
- Apply min ratings threshold (default 30).
- Drop rows with missing user score or critical numeric fields.
- Repair runtime or track counts when possible; log repairs.
- Generate explicit exclusion reasons per row for audit.

Phase 3 - Feature Engineering
- Core numeric features: ratings, critic score, review counts, track stats.
- Temporal features: release year, time since debut, album index per artist.
- Category encoders: genre and descriptor multi-membership.
- Artist features: leave-one-out reputation and history-only aggregates.
- Album type dummies (Album, EP, Mixtape, Compilation).

Phase 3b - Feature Block Assembly
- Assemble feature blocks per config (features.blocks).
- Persist combined feature matrix to data/features.
- Save manifest with block metadata and feature names.

Phase 4 - Leakage-Safe Splits
- Primary: within-artist temporal holdout (last album per artist with >=2 albums).
- Secondary: artist-group split (no artist overlap, fixed seed).
- Store split manifests in data/splits for both strategies.
- Use train-only statistics for imputation and scaling.
- For time-based checks: train on early years, test on later years.

Phase 5 - Imputation and Missing Data
- Numeric imputation hierarchy: artist -> genre -> decade -> global (train only).
- Track imputation source for every imputed value.
- Record imputation rates; if high, trigger sensitivity runs.

Phase 6 - Modeling (Bayesian)
- Baseline hierarchical model: global + genre + artist random effects.
- Dynamic slope model: artist-specific time slopes.
- Priors: weakly informative; validate with prior predictive checks.
- Sampling: default tune/draws, increase for publication run.

Phase 7 - Diagnostics and Model Comparison
- Convergence: R-hat <= 1.01, ESS thresholds.
- Posterior predictive checks (PPC) on held-out data.
- WAIC/LOO with robust error handling.
- Flag NaN or divergent samples and record failure modes.

Phase 8 - Prediction Output
- For each artist, predict next album score with credible intervals.
- Output predictions with uncertainty and metadata.
- Store in data/processed and reports/.

Phase 9 - Sensitivity Analyses
- Vary min ratings threshold.
- Vary priors and model families.
- Compare with/without artist effects and genres.
- Document stability outcomes.

Phase 10 - Publication Artifacts
- Tables: summary stats, model comparisons, main effects.
- Figures: calibration, PPC, uncertainty by artist history.
- Model card and reproducibility report.

Phase 11 - Reproducibility
- Store exact configs, seeds, dataset hashes, and package versions.
- Provide a single publication pipeline entry point.

Outputs (expected)
- data/processed/regression_ready.csv
- runs/<run_id>/trace.nc
- reports/tables/*.csv
- reports/figures/*.png
- docs/MODEL_CARD.md

Legacy reference
- docs/lineage/DATA_LINEAGE_DETAILED.md is copied from the old project for step parity.
